# Hi, I'm Sanjana 👋🏽 💡

> AI/ML enthusiast with a strong drive to go beyond surface-level learning.

I'm a CS undergrad who gets genuinely excited about hard problems. I'm passionate about building a *deeper understanding* of artificial intelligence & machine learning — not just using tools, but understanding why they work. I love coming up with unique ideas that push me to think differently and challenge me to grow.

### 💛 What drives me

I'm driven by a deep curiosity to truly understand AI/ML — not just to use it, but to explore the *why* behind it. I learn and build every single day, with the goal of contributing meaningful, rigorous, and original work to the field. If a problem is hard enough to make me uncomfortable, I'm probably already hooked.
